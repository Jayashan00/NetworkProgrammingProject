To run the program
Configure the Server (Computer A)
This computer will act as the "Manager" and listen for connections.

Find your IP Address:

Open Command Prompt (cmd).

Type ipconfig and press Enter.

Look for IPv4 Address. It will look something like 192.168.1.5 (or 10.0.0.5).

Write this number down.

Check server.py code:

Make sure the SERVER_IP line looks like this:


SERVER_IP = '0.0.0.0'  # This tells it to accept connections from ANYWHERE
(Note: Do not put the 192.168... IP here. 0.0.0.0 is safer for the server side).

Run the Server:

Run the script: python server.py

Keep this window open. You should see: [STARTING] Server is listening...

Step 2: Configure the Client (Computer B)
This computer will act as the "Smart Device."

Open client.py code:

You need to tell this computer where the server is.

Find the SERVER_IP line and change it to Computer A's IP address (the one you wrote down).

Example:


# Replace 'localhost' with Computer A's IP
SERVER_IP = '192.168.1.5' 
SERVER_PORT = 5050
Run the Client:

Run the script: python client.py
Step 3: Verify the Connection
Look at the screen of Computer A (Server).

You should instantly see a message like:

[NEW CONNECTION] Device connected from ('192.168.1.X', 54321) ✅ [INFO] Smart_AC_Unit_1: Status OK | Value: 24°C

If you see this, you have successfully built a network application between two hosts!
⚠️ IMPORTANT: If it fails (The Firewall Issue)
If Computer B says "Connection Refused" or "Timed Out," it is almost always the Windows Firewall on Computer A blocking the connection.

Quick fix for the Demo:

On Computer A (Server), press the Windows Key and type "Firewall".

Select "Windows Defender Firewall".

Click "Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off" (left side).

Select "Turn off Windows Defender Firewall" for both private and public networks.

Click OK.

Try running the Client again. It should work immediately.

(Remember to turn the Firewall back on after your Viva!)
